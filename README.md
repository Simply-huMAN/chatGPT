>#### I made this project using React and Tailwind.
>#### Since this is a single page project, I made only two components of App.js and server.js

### Installation

>#### Download the zip file of my project
>#### Extract all the files from that downloaded folder
>#### Now install all the dependencies using the node package manager
>#### Just type "npm install" to install all the dependencies
>#### Now run the frontend page by typing "npm run start:frontend" in terminal
>#### Now open a new terminal, go to src folder
>#### Run "npm run start:backend" or "node server.js" to run the server
>#### Now you are good to go.
